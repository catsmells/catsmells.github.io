    <h1 style="color: #d1da86;"><b>there's a lot of evil one can avoid in life.</b></h1>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfor the average end-user and/or consumer, ethics fall second place to convenience.</p>
    <p>in fact, the majority of the population won't care about how useless/unethical/immoral/harmful something</p>
    <p>is if it means something is made more convenient in their lives as a result of using said product/service.</p>
    <p>it's a common myth that a more ethical life is inconvenient; it's rather easy to live an ethical life in</p>
    <p>your everyday! to make it easier for you, below is a list of things you can avoid if it means living more</p>
    <p>ethically. I should make some notes - nobody is perfect, and ethics are subjective. you can pick and choose</p>
    <p>from this list in accordance with your personal code, and that's perfectly fine! i must also suggest shopping</p>
    <p>only with small businesses whenever possible. not only can it help your fellow non-corporate man, but you learn</p>
    <p>to observe the disgusting consumer lifestyles brought upon us by big business; it's humbling.</p>
