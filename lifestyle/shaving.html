    <p>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspi remember my first shaving configuration like it was yesterday. it was a disposable razor from one of those sam's club 30-packs of the cheapest
      disposables i could get my hands on, plus a splash of water to the area of my face that i was about to shave. although it accomplished the end goal of temporarily
      eliminating the hair from the given section, it left my face exposed to the elements - ultimately leading to more zits & general discomfort. i would end up cutting
      myself all the time, and it felt like a chore; i wanted to get it over with so i could move on with my day.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe year i began shaving with such a setup, i received a norelco electric razor - one of those fancy three-circle systems. my mom's thinking was that
      it would probably be more comfortable than my current setup, and it wouldn't really require water. when it came time to use it, it was immediately clear that this was not
      a practical option - at least not for my face. it required a minimum surface area of about half an inch to work at all, and it often tugged on my hair. using water
      alongside it didn't really help, and it was a hassle to clean. still, it felt like a chore.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspit wasn't too long before i came across better options. i remember browsing /g/ one day, and coming across a shaving thread. i had a bit of change in
      my pocket i was willing to spend to try out better shaving options, and it seemed like a <i>hobby</i> worth getting into, rather than a chore that had to be done. right
      after reading a bit for a week (every time the general thread was made), i purchased a decent straight edge at a local anique shop - they even sharpened it for me! i rushed
      to the nearest ingles, got some OG barbasol & pinaud clubman, then excitedly awaited for morning. morning came, and i rushed to the bathroom. i took a hot shower (to allow my skin to open up & relax), brought in a washcloth to soak in the hot water, and got out.
      i put on the hot towel for a good five minutes, then applied the cream. after another five minutes, i started to shave like i normally did.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspshouldn't've read the last page of the book first; cut myself pretty bad on the first stroke. i rinsed off my face, and figured i'd grow out my facial hair
      while i find a better solution. i returned to the thread, reported my experience, and immediately (and understandably) got roasted for it. i continued to read it, and figured
      the best way to continue is to try out a double-edge (DE) safety razor. so rather than shelling out for a super nice tool, i drove to ingles and picked up a van der hagen razor.
      it was $20 & came with five blades, so i figured it was a good deal. when i got home, i re-evaluated my technique. i watched several videos on how to properly shave with a DE setup,
      and learned to fix my mistakes. at this point, i nearly had a beard going, so i figured i'd shower and try it again.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspi got out of the shower, hot rag in hand. i applied the cloth to my face for a solid five minutes, then immediately creamed my face. while the cream was working
      its magic, i put in the DE blade. i queued a bunch of serge gainsbourg on my thinkpad, and set it in the bathroom with me. i waited another five minutes, and started my initial stroke,
      just next to my left sideburn at thirty degrees - letting the weight of the razor do the work for me. it was a single two-inch drag, and it was completely clean! i rinsed the blade with hot water, and
      began my next stroke on the opposite side. clean! i then did the cheeks, the jaw, then the chin. i finished with the upper lip, and rinsed with the washcloth soaked in warm water. my skin
      felt absolutely amazing at this point, but it wasn't over yet. i aired out the washcloth, and applied it to my face. it was roughly twenty degrees cooler, and it felt strangely satisfying.
      after two minutes, i removed the cloth & splashed a couple dabs of pinaud's on my hand. i rubbed my hands together, and applied it. it was a burning sensation for the first second, then
      insanely relieving. i rubbed my fingers on the areas i finished shaving, and it was incredible. i cleaned up my tools, and walked outside.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmy face felt incredible. it was perfectly smooth, with no irritation. no pulling, no zits, no cuts. for the few days after, my skin was perfect. i couldn't wait to
      restart the ritual again. it felt like i perfected my shaving setup, and it was no longer a chore. of course, i realize this setup isn't going to work for everyone; use whatever
      works best for you. for me though, this was bliss.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspover the years i tweaked this setup, only with slight adjustments. my razor is the same van der hagen as before, but now with mild viking blades (i felt that
      feather blades were too sharp for my liking - nor were the 'cayenne' blades for me). i use the "pacific rush" barbasol, and that's about it. i know i might have a better experience
      if i use a fancy badger hair brush, or special soap - i just don't find them required for my experience. nowadays, i love to shave. it's a ritual in relaxation, not a chore.
