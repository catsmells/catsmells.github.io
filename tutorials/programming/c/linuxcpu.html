    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspif you're in the shockingly small population of users that do overclocking, development, etc. you're no stranger to resource monitors.
      you'll notice that cpu usage is more or less one of the more important things to keep in mind on a system - it's the brain of the system, after all! 
      in linux-based systems, there are plenty of ways to grab the actual percentage for cpu usage. in this tutorial, we're going to do it using the 
      c programming language!
    </p>
    <p>
      before we begin, i'm going to assume you already have a c compiler installed (i'll be using gcc). i'm going to assume you're
      using a system that utilizes the linux kernel, and i'm going to assume you have a text editor.
