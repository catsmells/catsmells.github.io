    <p>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwhen i started development on <i></i>the untitled utility project</i> (TUUP), i never expected it to garner the support it has today. i made it out of the spite and disdain i have
      for what computing has become, and it matured to a full-fledged protocol & ecosystem. although a lot of it is still in "stealth mode", it was of the opinion of not only myself, but the three
      additional co-founders at j-ark innovations to host a sort of event that would not only promote TUUP, but also test several things about it - all having to do with its community. after weeks of prep
      work, we're doing a hackathon.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      the hackathon itself will consist of two parts:
    </p>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>build stage</li>
      <br>
      <p>in the build stage, entrants will have 24 hours to develop their own program adhering to the TUUP protocol.</p>
      <br>
      <li>breach stage</li>
      <br>
      <p>in the breach stage, entrants will have 24 hours to attempt to breach programs made by other users.</p>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspusers will be able to sign-up via <a href="https://jark.tech/News/">here</a>, and submit their work to a special board on catterchan. the judge panel will be announced at the start of
      the hackathon, and it's a hell of a panel. while i won't be a judge myself, i <i>will</i> host a 48-hour livestream (yes, with no naps) during the hackathon. i'll discuss on many topics - from tech & autism,
      to the inner workings of TUUP.
