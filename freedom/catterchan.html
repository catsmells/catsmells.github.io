    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcatterchan is a bulletin board system (BBS) disguised as an imageboard, with the feel of a mid-2000s forum.
      it was developed as a successor to the mildly-successful <i>chadchan</i>, a much more primitive form of catterchan. i developed
      both with the intention of a sort of thought experiment in practice. what would happen if i made the only rule on it that you can't
      post anything illegal on it? what if instead of actual moderators, it was entirely community-operated? what if the content & posters were
      unable to be censored on it? thus chadchan (and later catterchan) was born. while i won't be talking about the features of chadchan,
      i will discuss the features & function of catterchan.

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcatterchan behaves like your typical imageboard. you can pick a board to go on, post a thread, wait for replies. each
      board has their respective rules to keep things more on-topic, but globally nearly everything is allowed. the more you post original content,
      the greater the chance of people becoming your "buddy" (like followers, subscribers, etc.) - after 1000 buddies, you gain monetization abilities
      via Monero payouts, a custom board for you to post on to your community, and a few other perks. if you simply want to post anonymously, you
      can too - i just disabled the ability to attach content to your posts, to curb bot abuse. if you register, none of the entered data is "real". if 
      you wish, one can use a fake e-mail address. privacy is an utmost priority, and the only reason accounts are used in the first place are for the 
      perks of being an independent creator.
