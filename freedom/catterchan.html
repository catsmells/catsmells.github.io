    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcatterchan is a bulletin board system (BBS) disguised as an imageboard, with the feel of a mid-2000s forum.
      it was developed as a successor to the mildly-successful <i>chadchan</i>, a much more primitive form of catterchan. i developed
      both with the intention of a sort of thought experiment in practice. what would happen if i made the only rule on it that you can't
      post anything illegal on it? what if instead of actual moderators, it was entirely community-operated? what if the content & posters were
      unable to be censored on it? thus chadchan (and later catterchan) was born.
