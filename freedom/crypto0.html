    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspblockchain tech isn't entirely new, but the concept seems to be novel for a multitude of common users. in fact, most 
      people don't have an idea of what blockchain is. the closest thing they know about is <i>crypto</i>, but even then it's only minute knowledge of
      Bitcoin usually. To slim it down further, the vast majority of people seem to only know of Bitcoin as a wacky thing to invest in that either idiots or 
      tech wizards actually use. those that heard of Bitcoin prior to the mainstream boom (in both popularity, and the price) consider it as a bit useless in
      today's world.
