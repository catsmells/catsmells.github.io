    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe <i>tinyweb</i> is more or less a new definition for something that used to exist - an intranet of</p>
    <p>typically <i>personal</i> webpages that surround a general genre of idea. before there was a term for it</p>
    <p>(mostly used on technology imageboards), users usually did it via word-of-mouth to drive traffic to one</p>
    <p>another. i'd argue that it's one of the best ways to not just learn about a singular topic, but also to</p>
    <p>learn about the people that keep that topic alive.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe typical tinyweb page uses little resources, rarely uses javascript, and tends to not use third-party</p>
    <p>resources. these pages are usually either self-hosted, or hosting on a free/cheap host that doesn't get in the way of user</p>
    <p>opinion (censorship). the tinyweb exists on the internet itself, while remaining as an intranet; things on the darknet (TOR)</p>
    <p>or blockchain are not usually considered "tinyweb", even if the same concept applies.</p>
