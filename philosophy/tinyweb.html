    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe <i>tinyweb</i> is more or less a new definition for something that used to exist - an intranet of</p>
    <p>typically <i>personal</i> webpages that surround a general genre of idea. before there was a term for it</p>
    <p>(mostly used on technology imageboards), users usually did it via word-of-mouth to drive traffic to one</p>
    <p>another. i'd argue that it's one of the best ways to not just learn about a singular topic, but also to</p>
    <p>learn about the people that keep that topic alive.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe typical tinyweb page uses little resources, rarely uses javascript, and tends to not use third-party</p>
    <p>resources. these pages are usually either self-hosted, or hosting on a free/cheap host that doesn't get in the way of user</p>
    <p>opinion (censorship). the tinyweb exists on the internet itself, while remaining as an intranet; things on the darknet (TOR)</p>
    <p>or blockchain are not usually considered "tinyweb", even if the same concept applies. </p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspin order to set up a tinyweb, you simply have two or more separate webpages, then create a link</p>
    <p>to each others' pages. these links are usually on either the homepage (to bring immediate attention to related users),</p>
    <p>or on a dedicated "links" page (to bring the most interested users). in a network of three or more users, those within</p>
    <p>the network should refer to every other webpage.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe tinyweb as a concept is one of the last parts of internet culture with actual soul. since</p>
    <p>its conceptual comeback, i've grown a new faith for internet users. people are slowly realizing the consequences</p>
    <p>of convenience, especially with social media. it's a lot more fun and educational to make your own simple webpage,</p>
    <p>and set up ever-growing networks with those with similar interests. speaking of, there's no rules against limiting</p>
    <p>your tinyweb to only one interest! you can be in more than one tinyweb per webpage.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspyou may be wondering what difference there is between the normal internet and the tinyweb.</p>
    <p>in the simplest of terms, there is no search engines. there's no reason for things like search engine optimization.</p>
    <p>it's just you, your friends, and a collective of those learning about similar things.</p>
