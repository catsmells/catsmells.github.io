    <p>&nbspthe <i>tinyweb</i> is more or less a new definition for something that used to exist - an intranet of</p>
    <p>typically <i>personal</i> webpages that surround a general genre of idea. before there was a term for it</p>
    <p>(mostly used on technology imageboards), users usually did it via word-of-mouth to drive traffic to one</p>
    <p>another. i'd argue that it's one of the best ways to not just learn about a singular topic, but also to</p>
    <p>learn about the people that keep that topic alive.</p>
