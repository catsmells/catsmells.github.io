    <h1 style="color: #d1da86;"><b>i despise python.</b></h1>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthis is the inevitable python article. people ask me all the time why i hate python</p>
    <p>so much, and i've been putting off this post for years at this point. funny enough, in all those years,</p>
    <p>few of the problems i originally had with python were resolved (or at least coming across as a</p>
    <p>compromise). before i begin my rant, i should start with an introduction of sorts.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthere are no "perfect" computer languages. they each have their uses, some more</p>
    <p>specific than others, and some are restricted by the hardware they were designed for. to me, a few</p>
    <p>languages come extremely close to being "perfect":</p>
    <ul>
      <li>c</li>
      <li>haskell</li>
      <li>cobol</li>
      <li>bqn</li>
      <li>ruby</li>
    </ul>
    <p>the above of course have their faults (some will be included in the rant). the aforementioned list -</p>
    <p>subjective in nature - will be wrong in the eyes of a lot of people, and that's fine! i cannot stress</p>
    <p>enough that my rant is purely of my own opinion, and there will be a lot who disagree with me. anyhow, let's</p>
    <p>get this over with.</p>
