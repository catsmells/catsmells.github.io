    <h1 style="color: #d1da86;"><b>i despise python.</b></h1>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthis is the inevitable python article. people ask me all the time why i hate python</p>
    <p>so much, and i've been putting off this post for years at this point. funny enough, in all those years,</p>
    <p>few of the problems i originally had with python were resolved (or at least coming across as a</p>
    <p>compromise). before i begin my rant, i should start with an introduction of sorts.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthere are no "perfect" computer languages. they each have their uses, some more</p>
    <p>specific than others, and some are restricted by the hardware they were designed for. to me, a few</p>
    <p>languages come extremely close to being "perfect":</p>
    <ul>
      <li>c</li>
      <li>haskell</li>
      <li>cobol</li>
      <li>bqn</li>
      <li>ruby</li>
    </ul>
    <p>the above of course have their faults (some will be included in the rant). the aforementioned list -</p>
    <p>subjective in nature - will be wrong in the eyes of a lot of people, and that's fine! i cannot stress</p>
    <p>enough that my rant is purely of my own opinion, and there will be a lot who disagree with me. anyhow, let's</p>
    <p>get this over with.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspi say we start with installation. incredible how such a popular language [allegedly]</p>
    <p>used to build so many enterprise and industry-standard systems isn't included with said systems!</p>
    <p>i'm all for the philosophy of a decentralized-esque system with zero bloatware, but this is different.</p>
    <p>example - the c programming language. both gnu & linux are made mostly with c, and in systems including</p>
    <p>both, gcc is included (that was poorly-worded, but you get the point). if python is truly the backbone</p>
    <p>of industry-standard and enterprise things, it should come built-in with the system (including IDLE).</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspso say it isn't built into your system. that's alright, but did you know that there's</p>
    <p>an obscene number of libraries and the like dependent on legacy versions of python that'll break upon</p>
    <p>update, so it's wise to install python 2x & 3x? i know it may be a slightly larger install, but that seems</p>
    <p>like something that'd be a problem in 2002, not 2022.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspi'd also argue that to python's ever-growing target audience of beginner programmers,</p>
    <p>python is not the easiest thing to install. the typical beginner won't be on a system where a package</p>
    <p>manager or building something from source is commonplace. they're going to rely on installers and the like.</p>
    <p>do you think they know what a PATH is? do you think they know what version to install if they just want to</p>
    <p>learn? the typical python beginner likely isn't going to learn by way of setting this stuff up in the first</p>
    <p>place - they're going on bootcamp websites where the output is updated live upon completion of a problem.</p>
    <p>that last point is a bit more directed to places like bootcamp websites, so i digress on this point.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppython trains users to prefer instant gratification. most python kiddies i've met</p>
    <p>can't tell me the output of written python code if they don't have the live output in front of them.</p>
    <p>i'd say this is only a beginner problem, but with languages such as c or c++ this doesn't seem to be</p>
    <p>an issue among beginners. python encourages poor practices for both programming/scripting, and thinking.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsomething i admire about certain languages like c is the amount of freedom you have</p>
    <p>while programming. python forces you to have proper capitalization, whitespace, indentations, and the like.</p>
    <p>the reasoning behind this is to have universally-readable code, which is a bit controlling. readability</p>
    <p>doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things, and it tends to come at the cost of larger program files</p>
    <p>and lack of efficiency. i should also add that if you care about the environment (many python-pushers</p>
    <p>claim to), you'll make it a priority to write efficient & small programs. While inconvenient to idiots (and</p>
    <p>those that have a second-grade reading comprehesion ability), you'll use less resources to run your programs,</p>
    <p>meaning the same hardware can be used for more things, which means you won't have to purchase more hardware,</p>
    <p>which also means a lesser demand for said hardware. if practiced at a large scale, this can drive down hardware</p>
    <p>costs, make proper programmers more valuable hires, and reduce slave labor in countries where materials are</p>
    <p>sourced and/or assembled. by being a programmer who can properly read and think, you can actually change the</p>
    <p>world for the better in ways corporate propaganda cannot comprehend.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspbefore you can even think about developing with python, your environment has to be properly</p>
    <p>set up. this is commonplace in many languages, but python in particular seems to be a little more painful. not</p>
    <p>only do you need more than one version installed, but you also need anaconda, pip, a decent editor, and all the</p>
    <p>third-party packages you didn't realize you needed. python makes it clear that your system will be designed to</p>
    <p>be a python workstation, and little else.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspa common practice in the industry today has unfortunately been made even worse with python -</p>
    <p>using third-party libraries to make your code work out of the sake of convenience. this was popularized with</p>
    <p>languages like javascript, but it never got to non-web programs at the scale that python has allowed. engaging</p>
    <p>in this practice brings each program closer to a more centralized internet. if a maintainner of a massively</p>
    <p>relied-upon library happens to shut down the repository for whatever reason, imagine the number of programs</p>
    <p>that will no work! in python tutorials, you'll often see the teacher tell you to rely on a convenient library,</p>
    <p>and they won't teach you the logic behind how the entire thing works. it's one thing to build a program that</p>
    <p>tells you crime statistics, but it's another to write a script that actually just computes the statistics via</p>
    <p>numpy, and the purpose of the script you wrote was to print the outputs in rainbow text. if the python</p>
    <p>software foundation is telling me that relying on others is one of the things that makes the language so easy-</p>
    <p>to-use, then it's a sham language.</p>
