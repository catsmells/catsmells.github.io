    <h1 style="color: #d1da86;"><b>there's a lot of evil one can avoid in life.</b></h1>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptoo many so-called "environmentalists" in tech seem to be all-too-fond of using flagship modern</p>
    <p>technology for the sake of having the newest possible gadget - usually as status symbols. said tech is usually slightly-</p>
    <p>improved technology solely as a marketing tactic, and not for anything long-term. if <i>laptop x</i> has a webcam that can</p>
    <p>automatically apply an anime filter to your face, so should competing laptops - no matter the price! don't have a laptop</p>
    <p>that can <i>handle</i> it? then you aren't using bleeding-edge hardware, or maybe you're poor. either way, you don't</p>
    <p>belong in tech if you don't have an absolute edge over other hackers. if you don't have a laptop that has an anime</p>
    <p>filter webcam, then you don't have an absolute edge.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspin the age of planned obsolescence and massive amounts of e-waste, you would've thought that</p>
    <p>more people in tech would catch on! you would think that they would be willing to write more resource-efficient</p>
    <p>code so that less resources are used/demanded/made, or encourage re-use of old tech...</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspunderground & niche tech hobbyists rely on what Big Tech would refer to as "outdated" technology</p>
    <p>for reasons of ease-of-repair, ease-of-modification, better durability, and low-cost. you can take it up another level</p>
    <p>by using software you've made yourself, or a more minimalistic system setup (in terms of software/firmware). after all,</p>
    <p>hobbyist developer communities have advanced quite a bit in recent years, so there's no longer a real reason to use</p>
    <p>any of Big Tech's current warez. by using an alternative system on top of your old hardware, one can optimize for</p>
    <p>already-existing technology. less resources used, less waste created, and less control to Big Tech.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe takeaway i wish you with is that i hope you think twice about purchasing that new phone, watch,</p>
    <p>laptop, or e-reader. consider the freedom that analog devices can give you, and ask yourself if you really need to buy</p>
    <p>new tech if you can simply use it on pre-existing tech.</p>
