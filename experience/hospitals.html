      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthat's what a senior campus informatics tech told me, regarding a corporate meeting they attended a couple of months ago.
      "corporate doesn't care about [information] security. if they lose half the entire billion-plus annual earnings to a cyberattacks, they'll still
      have sick & injured assets, and they'll still have a billion-plus in earnings annually."
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspafter our conversation, i was in utter disbelief. it wasn't that nobody in the IT department didn't care about security, it
      was more that the people running the hospital didn't care - nor had any reason to care. morality means nothing in the name of the cheapest possible
      dollar. so as nobody in corporate management cared, it gradually got tiresome for those actually running things in IT to keep reminding them of the
      constant flaws and dangers. so, it got even more stressful for IT folk to care, so they stopped complaining and started complying. after all, they'd
      still get paid at the end of the day.

      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspi first won a contract to do simple campus information support for one of the largest hospital networks in the US roughly a month
      ago. in the interview process, i was told by multiple people in the network that i was vastly overqualified for the position - and that the lack of
      security would likely drive me crazy. i took the contract anyways, and began my shift the following week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspas i approached the main building, i immediately noticed the lack of security cameras. i spotted two cameras - one was pointed
      straight up towards the sky, the other propped in a low-action corner of the hospital office building. going inside i noticed a massive lack of physical
      security - no cameras, one [unarmed] security guard for the entire multi-campus facility (turns out there was a grand total rotating shift of three guards),
      and nobody realizing i didn't have a security badge yet. i walk into the IT office, and it is absolute chaos. nobody knows what's happening. it appeared that
      in addition to contractors like myself being hired, the corporate office also sent their native IT employees to "help" us out.
