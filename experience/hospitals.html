      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthat's what a senior campus informatics tech told me, regarding a corporate meeting they attended a couple of months ago.
      "corporate doesn't care about [information] security. if they lose half the entire billion-plus annual earnings to a cyberattacks, they'll still
      have sick & injured assets, and they'll still have a billion-plus in earnings annually."
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspafter our conversation, i was in utter disbelief. it wasn't that nobody in the IT department didn't care about security, it
      was more that the people running the hospital didn't care - nor had any reason to care. morality means nothing in the name of the cheapest possible
      dollar. so as nobody in corporate management cared, it gradually got tiresome for those actually running things in IT to keep reminding them of the
      constant flaws and dangers. so, it got even more stressful for IT folk to care, so they stopped complaining and started complying. after all, they'd
      still get paid at the end of the day.

    <p>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspi first won a contract to do simple campus information support for one of the largest hospital networks in the US roughly a month
      ago. in the interview process, i was told by multiple people in the network that i was vastly overqualified for the position - and that the lack of
      security would likely drive me crazy. i took the contract anyways, and began my shift the following week.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspas i approached the main building, i immediately noticed the lack of security cameras. i spotted two cameras - one was pointed
      straight up towards the sky, the other propped in a low-action corner of the hospital office building. going inside i noticed a massive lack of physical
      security - no cameras, one [unarmed] security guard for the entire multi-campus facility (turns out there was a grand total rotating shift of three guards),
      and nobody realizing i didn't have a security badge yet. i walk into the IT office, and it is absolute chaos. nobody knows what's happening. it appeared that
      in addition to contractors like myself being hired, the corporate office also sent their native IT employees to "help" us out.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdue to all the chaos, i wasn't assigned any user account for the computer network. so, i was assigned to a corporate IT fellow to
      aid with the day's tasks. the first task i was assigned was to go solo to radiology storage and take note of how voip phones are in the room. i wasn't
      told anything about the layout of the hospital, and there weren't any blueprints. i assumed it wasn't going to be in the office building, but rather the
      main hospital, so i went on my journey.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspi went into the main building, and asked a front desk lady where radiology storage was. she wasn't sure, but told me how to get to
      radiology. she asked me to follow her to the elevator. just as we were getting in, another front desk lady yelled for her to ask for my badge. finally,
      some security! i told them both it was my first day, then mentioned the name of the regional director of IT. they then both let me on my way, with one lady
      showing me exactly where radiology was. apparently if you're in a hospital with business casual clothes & a swiss gear backpack on, you can do anything
      with enough confidence.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspi walk to the door for radiology. it was one of those large "crash" doors, where - when activated by a magnetic unlock - both doors open outwards.
      i walked up to the large doors marked with the radiation trefoils, and knocked. a nice lady opened the door for me, i said i was with IT. she looked at
      my laptop, then let me in. i asked where their main storage was, and she kindly pointed it out. i opened the unlocked door, took my inventory, then walked
      back to the IT office.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspit's wild, but that was an average occurrence in the span of the contract. being nice & confident let me into some extremely sensitive areas,
      from the pharmacy to the psych ward. i was constantly in view of patients where i shouldn't've been, i was able to gain roof access with little effort, and
      the majority of locks in the building could easily be breached with a credit card swipe through the crack. then there was the hospital storage area...
