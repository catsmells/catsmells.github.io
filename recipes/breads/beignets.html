    <h1 style="color: #d1da86;"><b>dr. cat's beignets</b></h1>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthis is a recipe i modified slightly from an old family recipe, which hailed back to the 1860s. they're more dense
      than most other beignets, but in a filling sort of way. they are light, fluffy, and just plain delicious. these beignets are the sort that
      go well with mild sunday mornings with family/friends. it's a sin to make them with chocolate, fruit, or anything else. as you prepare these
      beignets, take some french-roast coffee & chicory root - you'll make french press coffee with it. serve with black coffee.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>you'll need:&nbsp</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/6 cup vanilla extract</li>
      <li>6 cups bread flour</li>
      <li>1 cup evaporated milk</li>
      <li>2 good-sized eggs</li>
      <li>2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast</li>
      <li>a couple pinches of salt</li>
      <li>1 cup sifted granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
      <li>a stick of warm butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>you're also going to need:&nbsp</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>a jug of peanut oil</li>
      <li>a bowl of powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>this'll make enough beignets for 6 hungry friends, and a dog or two.</p>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>in a bowl, mix together the warm water, yeast, and sugar. combine them well, and let it sit till it becomes a little foamy.</li>
      <li>in a different bowl, beat the eggs till they're nice & smooth, then add half the flour. beat in the yeast mixture, then include the butter. continue mixing till smooth.</li>
      <li>go ahead & add the rest of the flour. mix until a good dough is formed.</li>
      <li>cover the bowl & put it in the fridge for two hours. if you'd like the beignets lighter, keep it in there for longer.</li>
      <li>get a cookie sheet, and line it with a few sheets of paper towels.</li>
      <li>fill a bowl with the powdered sugar.</li>
      <li>fill a deep cast iron pan (four inch minimum) with the peanut oil.</li>
      <li>take out the dough and make it into a rectangular log a couple inches thick. cut (either with scissors or hands) into one-inch rectangles.</li>
      <li>get the oil to medium heat. once it's going, drop a few dough rectangles at a time into the oil.</li>
      <li>once one side is golden-brown, flip it to brown the other side. when they're completely golden-brown, transfer to the toweled cookie sheet.</li>
      <li>after some of the oil gets soaked up, transfer the dough to the powdered sugar and toss. repeat this process until all beignets are sugared.</li>
      <li>serve!</li>
    </ol>
