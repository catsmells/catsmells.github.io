    <h1 style="color: #d1da86;"><b>everybody wants to know how to get better at programming.</b></h1>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwhether you're an absolute beginner or an expert looking to polish up their skills, programming challenges
      are a fantastic tool in the grand scheme of learning. as some may know, i've got a respository dedicated to the 4th edition of 
      the "pro/g/ramming challenges", a set of challenges made by the technology community on 4chan. it's helped me immensely in practicing
       my skills, learning new languages, etc. - and it's even helped in landing contracts / jobs! after going over several sorts of these 
      challenge posts (4chan, hackerrank, hackerone, etc.) i've decided to make my own challenge list.</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdo these challenges in whatever language you wish. for a greater challenge, do it in a language you're not
      familiar with! the challenges will range in difficulty. if you get stuck, refer to stackexchange, IRC communities, catterchan, etc. so long
       as you don't look up exactly how to solve the challenges. there will be no penalty if you plagiarize, except that you'll be cheating yourself. 
      rather than saving everything to directories on your device, push your files to a public repository using whatever means you please (git, SFTP, RFC 1149, etc.)
      so long as you're constantly pushing changes / new files.</p>
